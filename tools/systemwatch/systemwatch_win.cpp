/*
	Implementor notes:

	This class needs to get Windows messages.
	The easiest way is to get them from a top level QWidget instance.
	There was an attempt to use QApplication::winEventFilter(),
	but - as its name says - this is a filter, so all messages to
	all widgets go through it. So as a consequence, sleep() and wakeup()
	are emited many times during one event.

	Right now, there is a dummy window created just for SystemWatch.
	This may seem to be an unnecesary waste of resources, but the example
	above shows that too aggressive optimizations may hurt.
	A possible solution "in between" would be to catch events in already
	existing window (main window, probably)
	and pass them (by using ugly casting) directly to processWinEvent()
	But this would break the beauty of this tool.
